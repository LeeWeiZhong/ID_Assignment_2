# Covidata
Our project is a website which is about COVID. It displays statistics such as case, death and vaccination rates in an interactive world map users can click around to learn more. Besides showing data, the map can also bring up recent news about the pandemic's situation in that particular country, like giving out free tests, mask and vaccine mandates, etc.
 
## Design Process
This site is for people who wish to be up-to-date on anything related to the Covid 19 virus and pandemic as a whole. With Covid statistics and data that updates live and with the most recent news articles relating to the virus, this website is the best place to learn about all things Covid 19-related.

## Testing

<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
