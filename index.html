            This is a site that displays various useful information and data about 
            the COVID-19 virus from all over the world. Covidata shows relevant live 
            data about vaccinations, cases and more, and the most recent news 
            articles about the pandemic as well.

            What is COVID-19?
        </h2>
        <p class="content-text">
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe 
            acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case 
            was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread 
            worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, 
            fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may 
            begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of 
            people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who 
            develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop 
            mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe 
            symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% 
            suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). 
            Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people 
            continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, 
            and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to 
            further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
        </p>
        <p class="content-text">
            COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small 
            airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest 
            when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, 
            particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if splashed or sprayed with 
            contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated 
            surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus 
            even if they do not develop symptoms.
